# 2019-Hackathon-Group-Project
Wildfire detector


Group Project submitted during the 2019 CUNY Hackathon, we built a twitter scraping messenger that would scan twitter for forest fire information and then send it to the IBM ML platform to analyze the tweets and finally text the subscriber if information is found relating to forest fires in the subscribers area. We used IBM's natural language understanding to get a sentiment of the tweets, rather than just general discussion of forest fires we were trying to specifically get data about a ongoing fire nearby. The final implementation is flawed but at this point most of my team had about 3 months of programming experience so we were proud of what we achieved.
